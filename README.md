# boulder-tracker-v2

This is the 2nd version of my full stack web development application. The first version can be found [here](https://github.com/jamiema1/boulder-tracker-v1). While the project is still far from being complete, you can view the current production version [here](). Please note that features involving manipulating the database (add, remove, update) have been temporarily disabled for the production version. If you would like to see a demonstration of those features, please notify me and I would be more than happy to show that to you!

### To create the project, I used . . .
- Express.js framework along with MySQL to manage the backend
- React to build the frontend
- GitHub Pages for the frontend deployment
- Amazon Web Services to host the server, APIs and database

### Available Features
- Adding, editing, deleting, and viewing a gym, location, boulder, session, and climb

### API Documentation
To support the backend of this project, I created my own RESTful API and corresponding [documentation](https://github.com/jamiema1/boulder-tracker-v2/blob/master/API%20Documentation.md). This document details all the information related to each of the endpoints, such as attributes, status codes, and example queries and responses.

### Future Plans and Improvements
You can always check out the [Issues tab](https://github.com/jamiema1/boulder-tracker-v2/issues) to see what ideas I will be working on and have planned for the future. Feel free to let me know if there is anything that needs improvement and isn't already there!
