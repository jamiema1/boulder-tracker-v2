# boulder-tracker

This is a full stack web development application that keeps track of the bouldering problems that I have either completed or are still working on. While the project is still far from being complete, you can view the current production version at: https://jamiema1.github.io/boulder-tracker/. Note that features involving manipulating the database (add, remove, update) have been disabled for the production version as I have not setup a verification system yet to prevent unauthorized users from altering the database.

In the backend, I use the Express.js framework along with MySQL to manage the databases. 

In the frontend, I use React to build the UI.

To deploy the application, I am using GitHub Pages for the frontend and Amazon Web Services to host the server, APIs and database.

### Available Features
- Adding a new boulder problem to the database
- Deleting and updating existing boulder problems from the database
- Sorting and filtering boulder problems by various categories

### Future Plans and Improvements
You can check out the [Issues tab](https://github.com/jamiema1/boulder-tracker/issues) to see what ideas I will be working on.
